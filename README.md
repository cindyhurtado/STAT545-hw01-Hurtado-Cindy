### About me
-*Forestry PhD student*
+ from Peru
+ I did a master in Towson University. My master thesis involved the spatial ecology of reintroduced collared peccaries in the Ibera Natural Reserve in Argentina. You can find more information on the project here http://www.proyectoibera.org/especiesamenazadas_pecari.htm 

Here is how peccaries look like

 *All of the above was made in RStudio, I had some trouble adding the link for the picture then realized that I needed to open the image separately and then copy that link*
